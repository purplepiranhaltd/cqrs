The purpose of these tests is to ensure that when multiple modules are used (e.g. Permissions and Validation) that the following occurs:
a) All modules are triggered where necessary
b) Modules are triggered in the correct order *

* Module order
--------------
When multiple modules are registered the order in which they are registered defines the order in which they will be executed, 
with the last registered module executing first.

Example 1
---------
services
   .AddCqrs()
   .WithCqrsValidationModule()
   .WithCqrsPermissionsModule();

This will execute the permission check first, move to the validation check if the permission check is successful 
and then execute the command/query if validation check is successful.

Example 2
---------
services
   .AddCqrs()
   .WithCqrsPermissionsModule()
   .WithCqrsValidationModule();

This will execute the validation check first, move to the permission check if the validation check is successful 
and then execute the command/query if permission check is successful.
