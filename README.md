A library to aid the implementation of CQRS in .NET.

This library currently supports .NET8 and .NET9. We aim to support .NET versions that are currently within their Microsoft support term.

Starting with version 8 of this library the major version number will indicate the lowest .NET version supported by the library.

This library has been used in our own work for the last two years and is actively maintained.

Usage details will be added shortly.
